# Contact-List

This project has a real-time tracking of the contacts which gets added, using MogoDB database, from the Browser/Client to the Server/Database. 

We can also delete contacts in real-time from the Browser/Webpage. It will reflect on the screen then and there itself.

Used Ejs (template engine), CSS, Nodejs, Mongodb, Mongoose & Studio3T to accomplish this.
